# Diego's BBS API Overview

Diego is Cloud Foundry's next generation container runtime, and the BBS server is its central orchestrator.

The BBS accepts client requests from both inside and outside a Diego cluster, dispatching work to the [auctioneer](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/auctioneer) so it can balance work among the [cells](011-cells.md). In Diego, there are two distinct types of work:

- [**Tasks**](020-tasks.md) are one-off processes that Diego guarantees will run at most once.
- [**Long-Running Processes**](030-lrps.md) (LRPs) are processes that Diego monitors for health continually.  Diego can distribute, run, and monitor several identical instances of a given LRP. When an LRP instance crashes, Diego restarts it automatically.

Tasks and LRP instances run in [Garden](http://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden) containers on Diego Cells.  The filesystem mounted into these containers can be either a 'preloaded' rootfs colocated with the Diego cell or an arbitrary Docker image. Diego also provides some additional [environment variables](051-environment.md) to processes running in its containers.

In addition to launching and monitoring Tasks and LRPs, Diego streams logs from containers and cells to end users via the [Loggregator system](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator). Diego also allows clients to store routing data on LRPs. In Cloud Foundry, routing tiers such as the [HTTP Gorouter](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter) and the [TCP router](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-tcp-router) use this data to route external traffic to container processes.

Diego provides only a basic notion of client multitenancy via the concept of a [domain](050-domains.md). Enforcement of richer multitenancy, such as quotas for organizations or visibility restrictions for different users, falls on the [Cloud Controller](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng) in the case of Cloud Foundry.
